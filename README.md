# California-Housing-Price-Prediction-using-Linear-Regression
Here I have used the dataset of California housing prices from Kaggle

In this Project I have predicted the values using Linear Regression from scikit learn and have also implemented the code myself from scratch,
and have reached almost the same accuracy.
(note: The scikit learn uses parallel computing and multiple processing to do all the calculations whereas I have directly implemented the code without
considering that hence it will take alot of time to complete all the iterations.)
